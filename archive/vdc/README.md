# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - VDC Archives

Azure Virtual DataCenter (VDC) is foundational guidance which has been updated and distributed throughout the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aka.ms/CAF). The VDC brand is no longer a recognized or supported brand within Microsoft.

However, to avoid any disruptions to customer success, the archived guidance will be available in this repo for the next one year.
