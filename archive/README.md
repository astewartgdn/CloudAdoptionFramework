# Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Archives

The [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aka.ms/CAF) is the One Microsoft voice for cloud adoption in Azure, consolidating and sharing best practices from Microsoft employees, partners, and customers.

As of November 1st, 2018, there were approximately 60 competing approaches to cloud adoption used within Microsoft. As the authors and supporting teams join the contributor program, the proceeding approaches are updated, integrated, and/or archived.

As we transition through this process, our highest priority is the preservation of customer success. To ensure this transition creates minimal disruption, archived approaches will be stored in this repo for a period of one year from archive.
